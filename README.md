## Overview

This toy application has been created for an imagined workflow where you start from a TEI text, have an XSLT transform it into HTML, and extract entities from it, enriching them with data from the LOD.

The UI provides:

- a code panel for XML.
- a code panel for XSLT.
- a toolbar allowing you to load/save files, prettify XML, transform XML, extract entities from XML.
- a list of extracted entities.
- the details about any of the extracted entities, as drawn from DBPedia/Wikidata.
- for places, their location on a map. The location too is derived from DBPedia/Wikidata.
